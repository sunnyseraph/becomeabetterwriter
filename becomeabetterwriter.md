## Introduction ##


**_“A professional writer is an amateur who didn’t quit.”_** **Richard Bach**

I have a confession to make: I still feel like an amateur even after two decades of being a professional writer. I still have days when I wake up with self-doubt. And days when I encounter the dreaded writer's block. But I keep going because, more than anything else, I love to write.

If you're still reading, this book is meant for you. It’s not just for aspiring writers, but also for the more experienced writers among us who feel a little lost, or self-conscious, or need a little boost. This book is for you, for the writer who is willing to take action to improve his or her craft.

This book is **not** for:

1.	Armchair writers or journalists who gripe but are unwilling to 	do 	anything	to 	further	themselves.

2.	Aspiring writers who are unwilling to put in the work needed to become a better writer.
 
3.	'Experienced' writers who feel they have nothing more to learn.

This book **is** aimed at writers, both fledgling and experienced, who are willing to take things to the next level to improve their quality of writing, and by doing so, enhance their quality of life. For writing is often so tied to our sense of self, it is hard not to feel triumph when things start falling into place.

So dear writer friend, I wish you happy reading and great success with taking your writing to the next level.

Best wishes,
Sharmila
 

## Section 1: Getting Down To Basics ##

Those of us who have pets would have noticed that cats and dogs are creatures of habit. In fact, I'll go so far as to say that they **love** routine. And although they depend on us to inculcate certain behaviours and habits in them, the truth is, we humans can learn a lot from our pets where habits are concerned.

Where am I going with this rambling, you wonder? I'll cut to the chase: as a writer, you need to get the basics right to succeed in the long term. In other words, you've got to have healthy habits.

Healthy habits shape and mould you to become a better writer and person in general. I know this because I have suffered the consequences of having unhealthy habits for prolonged periods. A lack of healthy habits drains you and makes for poor writing output. Take it from someone who has been there and who doesn't want to you to tread the same path thousands of others have in the past.

You can be different. You can start out right as a writer by developing healthy habits from the get-go and give yourself the gift of success, provided you are willing to change your (wait for it) **habits**.
 
This appplies to experienced writers as well, who may be stuck in either a writing or life rut. Writers who want to climb out of such a rut but are not sure how. In the following pages, I'll give you the solutions that have helped me, along with some actions steps to take as you go through the different sections of this book.


### The Five Healthy Habits Every Writer Should Have ###


#### **_Get Enough Sleep_** ####

The problem with sleep is simple: most of us don't get enough of it. Studies have shown that getting proper sleep results in better physical and mental health, both of which are vital to writers. Journalists, in particular, are notorious for not getting adequate sleep (trust me, I've worked for 48 hours straight without sleeping!).

However, even freelance writers and other types of entrepreneurs are often sleep-deprived, and having improper sleep can have disastrous effects on one's life (i.e. a car crash from falling asleep at the wheel).
 
Even if you don't drive and spend long periods working from your home office, getting proper sleep is crucial for optimum brain function.

You may be able to pull all-nighters for a day or two, but you will lose your ability to function after that and what then? It's unlikely you will write anything of value when you are sleep-deprived.

This brings us to the ultimate question: how much sleep do we actually need?

I'm no doctor or sleep expert, but research has shown that adults aged 18 or older need between 7 and 8 hours of sleep a day (for more information, click here).

I personally get between 7 and 9 hours of sleep a day, the amount varies depending on how exhausting a day I've had and how much sleep I had the night before.

If I get fewer than 6 hours of sleep, I tend to be sluggish and cranky the next day and no amount of coffee can improve my mood. And when I'm in a crappy mood, my writing is affected. Enough said.
 
For more information on getting proper sleep and practicing good sleeping habits, check out the following:

**ACTION STEP: Do one thing today to improve your sleep and wake routine.** 

#### **_Eat Healthily_** ####

There's this famous saying that goes: "You are what you eat." You've no doubt heard this before, but have you taken it seriously? If you have and still do, then skip this topic and move on to the next. 

If you haven't and have been wondering why you feel like crap all the time, consider yourself one of the lucky ones. You have come to a certain level of realisation that your diet may be affecting your daily life, and all you need to do for yourself and yourself alone, is to transition to a healthier diet.

Of course, this is easier said than done when you live in a country like Malaysia, where eating out is common practice and cheap food is abundant.
 
Temptations lie at every street corner and most of these so-called local delicacies are also incredibly unhealthy. A friend pointed out to me recently that it is too difficult for her to have a healthy diet because she hates to cook, and so she puts up with greasy and fatty takeaway food. Because it is convenient for her, she said.

One may argue that it is more convenient to make a simple 20 or 30-minute meal at home rather than troubling oneself with having to look for a parking spot or weathering bad traffic. And it is; you actually save yourself the hassle and cost of dining out by making a simple meal at home.

It is a lot easier to get the five servings of fruits and vegetables a day with a planned, home-cooked meal than eating out all the time and barely meeting the five-a-day quota. Plus, cooking at home costs less in the long run so you'll end up saving quite a bit...and who doesn't love to have extra cash in their bank account?

The healthier you eat, the better you will feel. Not only will your body thank you, your mind will as well because it is being given the right nutrients at the right times. And that helps keep your mind sharp and active, which in turn leads to better quality writing.
 
To help you get started on your healthy eating journey, check out the following websites:

[EatingWell](https://www.eatingwell.com)\
[MindBodyGreen](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/recipes)\
[Greatist](https://greatist.com)


**ACTION STEP: Pick one dietary goal that you want to achieve by the end of this year, be it eating healthier or learning to cook your own meals.** 

#### **_Stay Active_** ####

Getting enough exercise is probably one of the things we prioritise the least as writers, especially those of us who are freelancers.

A successful entrepreneur said to me recently: "It is easier to be an irresponsible, than a responsible person". Similarly, it is easy to let our physical well-being take a backseat in our hurried lives. Health, however, should be at the top of our list of priorities.

Can't find the time to exercise for 30 minutes each day? Try breaking that into two 15-minute sessions of intense exercise such as interval training, speed walking or running. If you're not the gym type, take a group exercise class such as Zumba or jazzercise to really get your heart pumping.
 
Make time to attend at least two classes a week, and then spend that 30 minutes a day on at-home practice. Exercise boosts the endorphin levels in your brain, which in turn keeps you mentally alert and active.

I could go on and on about the health benefits of exercise, but there's Google to help you with that, so I shall refrain from waxing lyrical any further on this topic.

Here are some YouTube channels to get you started on your home exercise routine:

[BeFit](https://www.youtube.com/user/BeFit)\
[FitnessBlender](https://www.youtube.com/user/FitnessBlender)\
[Sarah Beth Yoga](https://www.youtube.com/@sarahbethyoga)


**ACTION STEP: Aim to exercise for 15 minutes daily to begin with, then ramp it up to 30 minutes daily the following week.** 

#### **_Read and read some more_** ###

Now that we've got you started on a healthier path, let's get down to the basic habit any writer worth his or her salt needs to have: being an avid reader. You really can't write unless you have knowledge about a certain subject and what better way to do that than to read intensely, and widely?
 
I don't know many great writers who aren't readers, be they locals (Malaysian) or non-Malaysians. Good writing comes from a place of knowledge, so get the ball rolling by reading on subjects that you want to write about.

Better yet, read about subjects that are alien to you (like archaeology, for instance) even when you don't have to. Not only will you learn something new, you may also pick up a different writing style or new vocabulary that can help you later on in your writing career.

But reading takes up a lot of time, you say. Time that can be spent on writing, you lament. I don't disagree that reading does take up a lot of time, but if you sincerely enjoy reading (and I believe you do, otherwise you wouldn't be here), you need to make time for it.

Use technology to help you maximise your reading time. Use a news aggregator such as Feedly or  Instapaper (the latter allows you to save articles from your email and websites so you can read them later) on your mobile phone or tablet to keep up with the news. You may also want to invest in an e-book reader such as Nook or Kindle so you can read at your own convenience, without having to lug a physical book around. It only takes a little time management and creativity to fit reading into your daily life.
 

#### **_Develop and stick to a daily writing routine_** ####

When you're a freelance writer or full-time journalist, your job dictates that you write every single day, whether you want to or not. There's no time to contend with writer's block (we'll come to that in a later section) or anything that could take you away from writing because you are expected to meet deadlines.

Otherwise, you won't get paid, or you could lose your job. That's just the way of the world, although hobby writers might disagree. Perhaps you work a 40 hour-a-week job and are too tired to write when you get home. Or you might be a stay-at-home parent with too many distractions to develop a daily writing routine.

If you're not yet a professional writer but aim to be one (and yes, this includes unpublished authors), you need to apply the same tenacity and discipline that full-time writers do to hone their craft.

This could mean having to wake up an hour earlier each day to get an hour of writing done, or getting your spouse to help out with the kids so you can get some writing done before you retire for the night.
 
That is something only you can work out, along with your loved ones. It's really a question of priority; you need to ask yourself how important writing is to you. 

If the answer is positive, then work with that and find yourself a free hour or two if possible, just to write. Better yet, set writing goals related to the writing project you are working on and hold yourself accountable.

Accountability is not as easy as it sounds, however. Not when you try to do it alone. See if you can team up with another writer in a 'buddy system' to hold each other accountable where writing goals are concerned.

Or if that is not doable, ask your loved one to help you be accountable by sharing your writing goals with him or her. People are often more supportive than not; just be sure to pick someone who you trust and is non-judgmental and you will get further with your writing goals than you ever imagined!

**ACTION STEP: Pick just one habit that you would like to develop so you can become a better writer. Assign a goal to this and write down how it will make you feel to succeed at it. Write down affirmations to help you stay motivated.**
 

## Section 2: Using Technology ## 

Many writers I know find themselves overwhelmed by technology, be they millennials or baby boomers. So why do we feel overwhelmed? It's not because we are not technology-savvy, in fact, many of the savvier writers I know are ones who feel that technology is rapidly taking over their lives.

Some freelancers, for instance, complain that they not only have to manage client communication via e-mail and phone calls, but also find themselves navigating multiple WhatsApp groups and managing their own social media channels.

I empathise with them; mainly because I sometimes find myself in the same situation. But I have news for you: you can't run away from technology or social media because you need to stay relevant in today's fast-changing world.

The key thing to do is to compartmentalise and pare down the number of applications or software you use to the absolute minimum. Then and only then, can you embrace the technology you really need to get your freelance writing business going.
 
In this section, you will learn about the essential productivity tools every freelance writer needs to have.

Bearing in mind that you are likely already using a number of applications on your computer and mobile phone, I will limit this list to four.

Remember, these tools are all about helping you become more productive as a writer, so use them judiciously.

### Four Essential Productivity Tools For Writers ###

Here is my list of top productivity tools for writers, in no particular order:

#### **_Best personal task management app: Remember The Milk_** ####

I started using this app on my iPad (you can also use the browser-based version on your desktop or laptop) a few months ago and am very happy with its features.

While I use Trello with my fellow volunteers for the non-profit we volunteer for, I find that Remember The Milk is an excellent personal task manager.

Among the features I like in the paid version are:

•	E-mail reminders (customisable feature)
•	Tasks can be broken down into sub-tasks and prioritised according to colour codes.
•	Notes can be added to tasks.
•	Integration with Evernote, Gmail and Google Drive.
•	Task sharing with other people.

I find that using this app, in addition to my physical bullet journal, lets me stay organised (and sane), with the ability plan weeks and even months ahead of time.

Sign up for and download the app here: [Remember The Milk website](https://www.rememberthemilk.com).


#### **_Best grammar-checking tool: Grammarly_** ####

Another useful free-to-use application every writer needs is free grammar checker Grammarly. Simply sign up for a free account (there is also a paid version) and install the extension in your web browser, which should take care of your e-mails.

I like that the free version also has a Microsoft Word add-in to help you produce error-free copy in Word.

The free tool isn't perfect (it sometimes misses contextual errors), but by and large, it does its job quite well. Finally, install the free version on your computer in order to help you correct errors in non-Word documents, as well as social media applications such as Facebook and WhatsApp.

For a simple, detailed guide on how to use Grammarly effectively, check out this [Grammarly Tutorial](https://techjury.net/blog/how-to-use-grammarly/#gref).


#### **_Best note-taking and research application: Evernote_** ####

I have this habit of carrying around my laptop when I'm at events or conferences, simply because taking notes on Evernote is such a joy. My laptop is pretty portable and I almost always get a seat at these events, so typing is fairly easy on it.
 
Hence, my note-taking software of choice is Evernote (in fact, I wrote this e-book on Evernote) and I also use the software to do web research.

Evernote has a web browser extension that you install, which lets you 'clip' articles and images from the Web to save for later. You'll also need to download the software itself to your computer to input the actual notes and organise the clips, which is a fairly easy process.

Everything is stored in the cloud, so again, you save precious computer disk space. I highly recommend Evernote not just for note taking, but for writing as well since using it for research and writing is pretty seamless.

Here's a pretty handy guide on using some of the cooler Evernote features: <https://techpp.com/2022/11/24/evernote-tips-tricks>.


#### **_Best financial management tool: ZohoBooks_** ####

Let's face it: all we want as writers is to just write. But the reality is, as a freelancer, you've also got to manage your business operations, marketing and finances.
 
Managing finances is easier said than done when you're a solopreneur with limited financial resources and time. All you want is a quick (and possibly free-of-charge solution) to manage your finances for you.

I'd love to tell you that is possible, but you still need to be involved in managing the financial aspect of your freelance business.

Thankfully, there's a free web-based accounting software called ZohoBooks that is simple to use and has a host of features that are related to finance, such as invoicing. There are more features, which you need to pay for (at a very reasonable USD12 a month) and they are so very worth it.

Yes, you will need to input the data yourself, but you can also link your business bank account to keep track of money going in and out of the account.

Here's a beginner-friendly introduction to ZohoBooks: <https://www.zoho.com/books/welcome-guide.html>.

**ACTION STEP: Pick just one of the tools listed here to startout with. Make sure you are clear on why you need it and cut out one other application from your daily schedule (if you can) to help maximise the time spent on technology. All the best!**
 
## Section 3: Handling Common Problems ##

Most writers love simple, uncomplicated lives. However, as you probably already know, life doesn't work that way. Sometimes life throws us curve balls and we need to be in a healthy mental state to handle them as they come and go. There are some problems that afflict writers more than they do other people and I'll take you through the three most common ones in the following section.


### The Three Common Problems Writers Face and How To Overcome Them ###

#### Lack of self-confidence ####

Writers are a particularly sensitive breed, and with this sensitivity often comes self-doubt and an overall lack of self-confidence. I've seen many confident people turn to jelly when it concerns showing their writing to others, especially if it involves creative writing.

Some of them are seasoned journalists with years of writing non-fiction behind them, but crumble when it involves a 'new' field such as fiction or other creative writing. I should know, I belong to the latter category.

I began writing poetry again after nearly 20 years and it took me nearly a year before I started publishing my work on Twitter and an NFT platform.

So you see, you are not alone. Writing is a very personal thing for most of us because it comes from deep within. As writers, we tend to tie writing to our self-worth and personality, which can be our undoing at times if it impacts our self-confidence.

To help you put things into perspective, try to remember that at the end of the day, writing is just a job. Whether you get that novel published or not does not determine your self-worth...that is up to you and you alone.

Ultimately, you direct your self-image and self-worth, so do navigate them in the right direction: one that will elevate your sense of self.

Here are some resources to help you with your self- esteem:

<https://tinybuddha.com/blog/6-simple-personal-commitments-to-overcome-low-self-esteem/>
 

#### Writer's block ####

The bane of every writer is, of course, that dreaded writer's block that plagues us every now and then. And it always happens when we least want it to.

Here are some techniques to beat writer's block that I have found particularly useful. I hope you'll be able to capitalise on at least a few of them to keep the ideas flowing:

**Free-writing.** When in doubt, get inside your own head to banish writer's block. Cast aside all worries concerning what you're supposed to write about and instead, focus on the act of writing itself.

I recommend carrying around a pocket-sized notebook and pen with you wherever you go for this purpose. Spend 5 to 10 minutes writing down whatever comes to mind, and don't censure yourself.

Once you're done, close the notebook and do something else for the next 15 minutes or so. Then, return to your notes and see if you can unearth anything useful. You'll be surprised at how effective this method is!
 
**Start a journal.** I write poetry and fiction, as well as non-fiction for my corporate clients, so running out of ideas is not an option for me. Feeling pressured to write is not a good way to rid yourself of writer's block, however.

Get the pressure off your mind by writing your thoughts down in a journal (pen and paper work best, although an online diary or voice notes also does the job). You may not solve the writer's block problem immediately by using this method, but you'll certainly release the pent-up frustration you feel for not being able to write.

**Take a break.** Pressured by deadlines? All the more reason you should take a break. Save your work and leave your desk. Do a few stretches or take a 5-minute walk outside if possible. Or if those are not feasible options, try a 5-minute guided meditation video on YouTube to help you relax and refocus. I personally find getting away from my desk for a drink of water or a brief chat with a friend helps relieve anxiety.

**Take up meditation.** Before you dismiss it as new-age mumbo jumbo, I recommend allocating at least 10 minutes each day (preferably just after you wake up in the morning) to meditate.
 
Studies have shown that meditation helps relieve stress and anxiety, which interfere with your ability to focus and think clearly.

Here's a good article from Harvard Medical School on meditation’s many benefits: <https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/mindfulness-can-help-you-tame-fears-and-worries>.

#### Procrastination ####

From my experience, procrastination affects everyone and not just writers. Ultimately, procrastination is a choice you make: you can choose to write or not, that's all it boils down to really. So how does a writer banish procrastination? That is pretty easy, you've got to decide that you are going to write and that nothing is going to stop you.

Often, writers procrastinate because they are too intimidated by the writing project at hand. When you're faced with finishing a 35,000-word novella, for instance, the word count alone can seem daunting.
 
Get yourself on track by breaking down a project into smaller chunks, of say, 1,000 words a day. If you're using Microsoft Word, you should be able to write 1,000 words easily within an hour. Better yet, set a timer so you can feel good about achieving that 1,000-word target within the hour.

The second thing I recommend is to reward yourself. When you hit a milestone, give yourself a treat for achieving it, no matter how small the milestone. Let's say you write 800 words instead of your 1,000 goal. Celebrate it anyway.

This will keep you motivated to write and to keep at it until you finish the entire project, or whatever your writing goal may be. An extrinsic reward really helps motivate you to keep going, until the day when you will just write because you are in the habit of doing it daily.

If the above fails, I recommend that you get yourself a writing buddy. This buddy does not need to share your space, but you need to share your writing goals with him or her so you will be accountable.

Your buddy will help you do what you cannot do alone and before you know it, procrastination will be a thing of the past.
 

**ACTION STEP: Which of these problems is unique to you? Pick a problem and with some free-writing, generate creative solutions to the problem. Discuss these solutions with a friend or other trusted person to see if they are feasible. Ask this friend to help you be accountable to your goals.**
 
## Section 4: Playing The Game ##

Whether you're a freelance writer who's just starting out or an aspiring author aiming to get published, you need to know how to play the game.

Sadly, merit is no longer the determining factor in getting ahead as a writer. Merit and the quality of your work matter of course, but so does how you brand yourself.

I'm not saying that branding and marketing yourself well will guarantee success as a writer, but they certainly help in getting you noticed and stand out from the crowd.

### How To Rise Above The Competition ### 

Here are some of the important things you need to do to get ahead in the game, whether you're a freelance writer or aspiring author:

#### Network, network, network. ####

I can't stress enough the importance of growing your personal and professional networks. The latter is especially difficult for natural ambiverts like myself, but it isn't impossible. You just need to work a little harder than extroverts at networking, but it is very doable.
 
Networking is a skill that can be learned, and it will help move mountains when you feel your writing career isn't where you want it to be just yet.

If you're a freelancer, a good network will help you land clients and through word-of-mouth, more clients. An aspiring author may even land a book publishing deal if he or she rightly leverages on his or her network.

But don't just use your network to get what you want, help the people in your network any way you can and that goodwill and good karma will come right back to you, in one way or another.

Sometimes people take the networking bit too seriously and forget that the people in their professional network are human, after all. So don't expect too much and get too disappointed if you don't get what you want immediately.

Building relationships takes time and effort, and a lot of consideration and patience on your part. Networking is a two-way street and the more realistic you are about it, the more you're likely to get out of your network.
 
Here are some excellent reads on networking from the Web, for the introverts among us: 

<https://www.themuse.com/advice/an-introverts-guide-to-networking>\
<https://www.thebalance.com/networking-tips-for-introverts-2061377>

#### Keep your writing skills sharp ####

The ability to write is like a muscle that needs to be exercised; so to keep your writing skills sharp, you need to consistently and diligently work on your craft.

So how do you remain on the ball at all times? The first thing you should do is tap into your professional network for the latest updates on your industry.

Ask your friends and acquaintances questions and don't be afraid to go one step further and join international professional networking groups on Facebook, LinkedIn and even Slack. By doing this, you get fresh perspectives on how your industry works worldwide, and by doing so, help keep your writing relevant and up-to-date.

Secondly, stretch yourself by reading on different subjects every now and then. I covered this in a previous topic, in that you need to read as widely as possible.
 
Reading widely also allows you to be relevant and relate to people outside of your industry or field, hence helping you build credibility with a more diverse group of people.

Attend seminars and conferences that you are interested in every chance you get, as well as networking events. You'd be surprised at how much you'll learn from attending such events.

Thirdly, write as often as you can and not just for work, either. Dabble in creative writing, even if you spend just 15 or 30 minutes a day on this. Creative writing is a good way of 'escaping' the stress of your work-related writing and gives you mental reprieve from work pressure.

Finally, to keep your writing skills sharp, make sure to take frequent breaks to recharge your batteries. I recommend taking a 5-minute break every hour that you spend on work, even if it is just stepping away from your desk.

#### Practise social media etiquette ####

There's a reason appropriate and relevant social media posts gain traction with audiences. I have noticed that in Malaysia, a number of writers and journalists enjoy ranting about their bosses or clients on their Facebook or even LinkedIn page, which is a big no-no for even the most established writer.
 
Practising self-restraint on social media may be difficult for some when they feel there are so many willing people to listen to them, but the reality is lashing out at people on social media hurts your reputation in the long-term. No one likes someone who constantly complains, neither do they trust such people.

When you're in the early stages of your writing career and need to build relationships with other writers and potential clients, you don't want to have the baggage of what you once said on social media. This goes for Twitter, as well as Instagram. Don't post anything, especially photos, that you will regret. Because once something is on the Internet, you can't take it back.

This is an especially good article on the topic: <http://annerallen.com/2014/04/the-10-commandments-of-social-media>.

**ACTION STEP: Pick one area that you have been struggling with and set some goals for that particular skill or attribute you are trying to develop. As suggested before, get a person you trust to be your buddy to help you keep track of your goals and milestones.**
 
## Conclusion ##

To be honest, I wrote this e-book partly for myself and partly for my fellow writers.

Perhaps I needed a reminder (or just validation) of the strategies I have employed in the past (and continue to employ) to improve myself as a writer.

I hope this book will benefit you and help you grow as a writer. All I ask of you is that you continue writing, and believing in your truth as a wordsmith.

Yes, being a writer involves perseverance and being realistic and I wish you these (and more), in bucketfuls. Most of all, I wish you success in achieving your writing goals and dreams.

Best wishes,
Sharmila Ganapathy
